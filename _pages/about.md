I am a graduate student pursuing [Masters in Mechanical Engineering](https://www.eng.famu.fsu.edu/me) at [Florida State University (FSU)](https://www.fsu.edu/) on [Fulbright Scholarship](https://foreign.fulbrightonline.org/). At FSU, [Dr. Juan C. Ordonez](https://www.eng.famu.fsu.edu/me/people/ordonez-j) is my major advisor and I am part of his Thermal Management Group at [Center for Advanced Power Systems (CAPS)](https://www.caps.fsu.edu/). During masters, I also served as a Graduate Intern (Thermal Optimization) at [National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)](https://www.nrel.gov/) under the supervision of [Dr. Alexander Zolan](https://www.nrel.gov/research/staff/alexander-zolan.html). 

My areas of research interests and expertise are: Energy Systems, Renewable Energy, Heat Transfer, Thermal Modeling, Concentrated Solar Power (CSP), Machine and Deep Learning, Data Analysis and Thermal Optimization.
